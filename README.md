# E-Commerce Business Analysis - Data Analysis Project

## Introduction

As a Data Geek and aspiring Data Analyst, I have analyzed a dataset related to an e-commerce business and presented my findings. This project leverages Excel skills to uncover valuable insights into the business's performance, including year-on-year growth, sales & profit analysis, state-wise sales, category-wise profit & sales, and the top subcategories by sales.

## Questions to Analyze

To understand the E-Commerce Business, I focused on the following key questions:
1. **Year on Year Growth** of the business
2. **Sales & Profit** trends
3. **State-wise Sales** distribution
4. **Category-wise Profit & Sales** breakdown
5. **Top Subcategories by Sales**

## Excel Skills Used

Throughout the analysis, I utilized the following Excel skills:
- **Pivot Tables** üìä
- **Pivot Charts** üìà
- **Power Pivot** üí™
- **Power Query** (ETL) üîç

## E-Commerce Business Dataset

The dataset used for this project is from Kaggle.com and includes data relevant to an e-commerce business, including:
- **Customers** üë®‚Äçüíº
- **Products** üí∞
- **Orders** üìç
- **Sales** üõ†Ô∏è

The dataset is available for download on Kaggle.com and provides a foundation for analyzing the business data in Excel.

## Process

### 1. Data Extraction (ETL with Power Query)
I began by using **Power Query** to extract the original dataset (`Ecommerce Sales Analysis Dashboard.xlsx`), which served as the basis for my analysis.

### 2. Data Transformation
I transformed the dataset by:
- Changing column types
- Sorting rows
- Reordering columns
- Trimming excess whitespace

### 3. Data Loading
The transformed dataset was then loaded into an Excel workbook, setting the stage for deeper analysis.

## Key Insights

### 1. Year-on-Year Growth of the Business
- **Yearly Growth**: The e-commerce business saw a **positive year-on-year growth** with a **20.62% increase in sales** and a **14.41% increase in profits**.
- **Profit Margin**: Although the profit margin has slightly decreased, the overall growth trend remains positive.
  
**So What**: This indicates a strong long-term growth trajectory. The focus should now shift toward optimizing the profit margin alongside boosting sales.

### 2. Sales & Profit Analysis
- **Highest Sales & Profit**: December was the highest-performing month for both sales and profits, followed by November and September.
- **Slow Months**: January, February, and April showed lower sales and profits.

**So What**: This monthly variation in sales and profits is crucial for business planning. The company should align product distribution strategies with these seasonal trends.

### 3. State-wise Sales Distribution
- **Top Performing States**: California, New York, and Texas contributed the most to sales.
- **Lowest Sales**: States like West Virginia, Maine, and South Dakota had significantly lower sales, totaling only $3.8K out of the overall $2.297 million in sales.

**So What**: The company should focus on increasing product supply and marketing efforts in high-performing states like California, New York, and Texas. Additionally, understanding market dynamics in states with lower sales can help optimize sales and competitiveness.

### 4. Category-wise Profit & Sales Breakdown
- **Top Category**: The Technology category, particularly the Phones subcategory, was the largest driver of sales.
- **Underperforming Category**: The Furniture category contributed only $18.45K in sales.

**So What**: The Technology sector has proven to be the most profitable, and the company should continue to focus on enhancing its product offerings and marketing strategies in this category. Conversely, efforts should be made to improve the Furniture category's performance.

## Conclusion

This project provided valuable insights into the e-commerce business's performance, utilizing Excel features like Power Query, PivotTables, and PivotCharts. By analyzing the dataset, I uncovered key correlations between sales, profit, and the business's performance across various dimensions, including states and product categories.

As a data enthusiast and aspiring data analyst, I hope this project serves as a practical guide for others and highlights the importance of utilizing Excel for data analysis.
